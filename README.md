## Usage ##

The program tries to load a file named *todo.txt*.
If it can read it than load lines into a structured array.

If click on "Add entry" button, than a new form window come up and you can fill it with the new todo entry's informations.

It is a feature that the creation date and completion date are always present.

To edit an entry you have to click on any cell of the row except the first (fixed). The first cell is represents the status of the entry. If it contains an *x* character, than it's already done and you can not edit that entry.

To mark an entry to completed or reenable it, you need to click on the containing row's first cell.

## Todo ##

- Deleting an entry is not implemented.
- It should be prettier if the style of the text change when the entry is completed.
